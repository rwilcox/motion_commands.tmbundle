# Motion Commands for TextMate  #

Additional motion / selection commands for your text editing.

## Features ##

Ever want to select a whole line in one keystroke?

Or delete the current line without selecting it first?

This is the bundle for you

Because why do things with two commands (command-right arrow, shift+command+left)
when the computer can do it for you?
